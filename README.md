# Text-Summarization-using-NLP
Overview
This project implements a Text Summarization algorithm using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to reduce the size of a given text while preserving its key information and main ideas. This can be particularly useful for generating summaries of long documents, articles, or reports.

Features
Text Summarization: Automatically generates concise summaries from long texts.
NLP Techniques: Utilizes advanced NLP algorithms to analyze and process the text.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): Library for working with human language data.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and text processing.
Gensim: For topic modeling and document similarity.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kchaithanya123/Text-Summarization-using-NLP.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd Text-Summarization-using-NLP
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the summarization script:

python summarize.py
Input the text you want to summarize. The script will output a concise summary.

Example
Provide an example of input and output if possible:

Input Text:

arduino

[Insert a long text here]
Output Summary:

arduino

[Insert the summarized text here]
